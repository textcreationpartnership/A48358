            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In the old law, leſt the people of God might be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>u'd with falſe coyne, and weights, the originall <hi>Cycli,</hi> and originall weights were conſeru'd in the Sanctuary of the Temple, and no money, or weights
<pb facs="tcp:66422:4"/>allow'd which were not conform to the original's of the ſame Sanctuary. Likewiſe that the ſame people might not be deluded with falſe coyns, and weights of doctrine, the chaire of Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes by diuine diſpenſation was cloathed with infallibility. The high Prieſt how wicked ſoeuer could not vtter wicked doctrine from Moyſes chaire, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rs euidently from Chriſts own words Mat. 23. <hi>The ſcribes and Phariſes ſit in Moyſes Chaire &amp;c.</hi> From which ſacred Text S.

<pb facs="tcp:66422:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>be of vndoubted truth. Moreouer the children of Iſraël, were bound to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the ſentence of the high Prieſt, the law condemning of pride, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing with death thoſe, which diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed the commandement of the Prieſt, that miniſtred to our lord, and the Decree of the Judges.</p>
            <p>In the new law leſt Chriſtians might be carried away with euery winde of doctrine S. Peter, and his Chaire by diuine diſpenſation were inveſted into much better priuiledges, then Moyſes, and his Chaire. For our Sauiour tooke ſpeciall care, that S. Peter might not fall away from the true faith, as does euidence his prayer. Luc. 22. <hi>Oraui pro te (Petre) vt non deficiat fides tua:</hi> I haue prayed for thee (Peter) that thy faith faile not: and doubtleſſ his prayer was effectuall according to the
<pb facs="tcp:66422:5"/>Apoſtle (Hebrae. 5.) <hi>Exauditus est (Christus) pro ſua reuerentia.</hi> Our lord prouided for S. Peter that his faith might not faile, to the end ſaith S. Leo (ſer. 3. de Aſſumpt.) <hi>The head being made invincible, the ſtate of all the rest might be more ſure:</hi> that is, the reſt thereby might be ſtrengthned, and confirm'd in faith. S. Peter accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to S. Ambroſe (l. 9. Noui Teſtam. 9.75. Tom 4.) after his denying of Chriſt was conſtituted the ſupream Paſtour of ſouls, becauſe, it was ſaid to him afore, <hi>When thou art conuerted confirm thy Brethren;</hi> neither was Chriſt's prayer offered in order to the perſon of S. Peter only, but likewiſe in reference to his office; according to the inter pretation of the beſt antiquity, ſo that the effect of the ſame prayer will
<pb facs="tcp:66422:6"/>continue as long, as the Church of Chriſt shall endure on Earth: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed euen as Chriſt commaunds S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to feed his sheepe <hi>Ioa.</hi> 21. ſoe he commaunds him to confirm his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren <hi>Luc.</hi> 22. but that ſaying of Chriſt: Feed my sheep, did not relate to the perſon of S. Peter onely according to all Orthodox Writers: but alſo to the office of ſupream Paſtour, which was conferd vpon S. Peter with intent to continue it in his ſucceſſours, being of neceſſary vſe in the Church: wherfore Chriſt ſaying to S. Peter, confirme thy Brethren, ought to carrie the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation; and in earneſt it were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt weaknes to giue vnto the ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of Moyſes greater prerogatiues, as to power, authority, and infallibility in the gouernement of the Synagogue, then to the Succeſſors of S. Peter in the
<pb facs="tcp:66422:6"/>gouernement of the Church of Chriſt; for this were to prefer the law of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage before the law of grace. In conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the premiſes the Roman faith of S. Peters ſucceſſors cannot fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le; not to fall away from faith is a priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge proper to the Church of Rome, that is, to the Bishops of that ſeate, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo plainly appears by the clear Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of primitiue Fathers. For exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple S. Cyprian Epiſ. 55. affirm's <hi>That infidelity, or falſe faith, is inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with the Church of Rome:</hi> S. Auſtin Epiſ. 66. <hi>auer's that our lord hath plac'd the doctrine of truth in the office, and Chaire of the Roman Church,</hi> and S. Bernard Epiſ. 190. to Pope Innocentius againſt Abailardus, writeth thus. <hi>We must refer to your Apoſtle-ship all the ſcandalls, and
<pb facs="tcp:66422:7"/>dangers, which may happen in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of faith, for there, defects in order to faith ought to be remedied, where faith cannot faile: for to what Other ſee was it euer ſaid, I haue pray'd for thee Peter, that thy faith faile not.</hi> Although Bishops of Rome that ſucceed in the Chaire of S. Peter may perſonally err, as priuate Doctours: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſ none euer did, or shall err iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicially, or definitiuely, that is none of S. Peters ſucceſſors haue, or shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiat from the truth in their conſiſtories, Courts, Councils, conſultations held concerning matters of faith, Religion and generall manners, becauſe Chriſt's prayer <hi>(I haue pray'd for thee Peter, that thy faith faile not)</hi> protects them. Wherfore the ancient Fathers recur'd to Rome, and applyed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
<pb facs="tcp:66422:7"/>to the Chaire of S. Peter in all matters of controuerſy pertaining to Religion, and faith, namely S. Auſtin and the Bishops of Affricke vnto Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centius the firſt, and vnto Celeſtinus (Epiſ. 90 95.) S. Chryſoſtome had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the ſame Innocentius (Epiſ. 1. &amp; 2.) S. Baſil to the Pope in his tyme Epiſ. 52. S. Hierom to Damaſus Epiſ. 5. 7 58. and S. Cyprian Epiſ. ad Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium, expreſly affirm's that, the cauſe of all ſchiſms, and hereſies proceeds from want of obedience to the ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Paſtour. <hi>Nec aliunde,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>haereſes obortae ſunt, aut nata ſunt ſchiſmata, quam inde, quod vni Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdoti Dei non obtemperatur, nec vnus in Eccleſia ad tempus Sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos, &amp; ad tempus Iudex vice Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti cogitatur.</hi>

            <p>From diſobeying of lawfull Paſtours began the notorious ſchiſm of Core, Dathan and Abyron, who roſe vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Moyſes, and Aaron, whome God had appoynted Chief Rulers ouer them, and the reſt of the Children of Iſraël; puft vp with proud thoughts of their own abilities, and conceipted worthineſſ, they were troubled, and grieu'd at the eſtablishing of prieſthood in the family of Aaron onely, and therefore arrogated to themſelues pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtly function againſt the ordinance of God, and to the vpholding of their ſchiſm coind a new Theology tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, that Moyſes, and Aaron tooke too much vpon them, lifting themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues aboue the people of our lord, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all were alike holy, and our lord with euery one of them alike: after the ſame manner all ſchiſms, and hereſies

Their intent and aime in riſing thus againſt the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Paſtour of the Church, is to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade the vnlearned, that the ſpeciall priuiledges of <hi>Paſce oues meas: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firma fratres tuos,</hi> which Chriſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

For example Luther afraid of the originall weights kept in the ſcholes of Orthodox Doctours sharpned his ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue againſt all the Vniuerſities of thoſe dayes, which he called <hi>Lupanaria Antichristi,</hi> the ſtews, or Brodel houſes of Antichriſt; and t'is common alike to all ſuch as coyne, or follow new opinions to haue an extream ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence from the ſcholes of Orthodox Doctours. But woe to all ſuch wanton ſchollars, as goe out from the reſt into ſeuerall ſects: for they perish in the contradiction of Core; <hi>They are
<pb facs="tcp:66422:10"/>clouds without water carried about of winds, Trees of Autumne wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thout fruit, raging waues of the ſea foming out their owne shame, and confuſion: wandring starres, to whom is reſeru'd the storm of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes for euer</hi> (Ep.

            <p>As the Prince of darknes by diuine permiſſion transforms himſelfe into an Angel of light, ſo he guideth the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils of Ambitious ſchollars vnto ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth falſe reſemblances of true faith. The extream wantonneſſ of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and high mynded Teachers by the crafty dealings of Satan has euen in our
<pb facs="tcp:66422:10"/>dayes turn'd Chriſtianiſm into great diſorder, and confuſion; As the People of Rome through the deluſions of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Magus were diuided in order to the true Selene, ſome conceiuing her to appeare from one window, ſome from an other, and ſome from as many win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, as darted ſeeming reſemblan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of her; ſo very many Chriſtian peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, eſpecially theſe of our own nation, fince they haue let goe their hold of S. Peters Chaire (that is ſince their fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling away from the obedience due to the Church of Rome, that firſt conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to Chriſtianiſm) are of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent iudgements, as to the true faith, deluded by the ſubtill ſleights of new Teachers, which according to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall luſtes of their high mynds haue diuided them into ſeuerall ſects: ſome be Lutherans, ſome Caluiniſts, ſome
<pb facs="tcp:66422:11"/>Proteſtants, ſome Anabaptiſts, ſome Independe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, ſome fift-Monarke men, ſome Quakers, ſome Deiſts, and ſome Atheiſts. There are now as many faiths, as wills, whiles either faith is repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as new Teachers will, or as they will, ſo is interpreted: and whereas ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to one God, one Lord, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne baptiſm, there is alſo but one faith, men of theſe dayes are faln away from that, which is the onely faith, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to belieue, that there is none at all, confounded with the great variety of ſeeming faiths; The ground wherof, as tis afore intimated is in regard, <hi>Non vnus in Eccleſia ad tempus Sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos, &amp; ad tempus Iudex vice Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti cogitatur.</hi> Becauſe due obedience is not exhibited to Chriſt's Vicar, and the Chaire by our lords voice founded on S.

<pb facs="tcp:66422:11"/>ſo in the new law, hereſies ſpring vp. The Childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Iſraël fell into ſchiſms, when they fell away from their due Obedience, to the Chaire of Moyſes; and Chriſtians fall into hereſies, as oft as they riſe againſt the Chaire of S.

               <p>
                  <hi>ADoration of the Croſſ is a Religiout honour, or worship according to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion exhibited to the true, or repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatiue Croſſ of Chriſt in reſpect of ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall excellency, or dignity.</hi> This is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:66422:44"/>Character in brief, which to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, and make plainly clear, it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruable.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that by the law of God, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, honour, and worship are due to excellency; in conſequence wherof there are as many diuerſe branches of honour and worship, as there be differing kinds of excellency.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Chriſtian Religion is a vertue, that by inward, and outward acts procureth due adoration, or wors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hip to be exhibited vnto the Creator in reſpect of his proper increated excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, and withall to creatures, in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of created excellency participated, and deriued from the Creator, who is the fountaine of all good things, and cauſe of all graces: and as between ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, and excellency, ſo between adoration, and adoration, there is eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall difference, excellency being the formall motiue, or cauſe of adoration.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, adoration or worship in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes of neceſſity two inward acts: one as to the vnderſtanding, which is knowledg of the excellency, in reſpect wherof adoration, or worship is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred; the other, as to the will, is an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, or willingnes in him that ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:66422:44"/>or worshipeth, to ſubmitt, and humble himſelfe to the thing ador'd, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd, or worship'd.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe inward actions are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite alſo in men compoſed of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuall, and ſenſible nature, outward ſenſible actions: for example proſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on the ground, bowing the body, head, or knee, &amp;c. And in aſmuch, as theſe outward doe correſpond to the inward acts, they bear the name of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward adoration, or worship.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, adoration, or worship is of two kinds; one ciuill, human, or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall: the other Religious, and ſacred. Ciuill or naturall adoration doth cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond to Ciuill excellency, dignity, or worthines, wherfore that kind of ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, or worship, is due euen to Ciuill Magiſtrats in regard of their charges, and offices, wherwith they are inueſted aboue, and ouer others.

                  <p>Temperance is a bridle to the flesh, wherby it is hindred from formenting of diſquietnes, and trouble to the mind: the property of temperan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce is to purge out of mans body the malignant humours, which tend to the preiudice of his ſoul: human flesh is the euill ſeruant, that requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth whipps, correction, and employment: the rebellion of the flesh comes of idlenes, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order: many good fruits proceede from abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, which is the daughter of temperance.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>TEmperance is a morall vertue, that ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth the ſoul to bridle the body:</hi> as a bitt is put into the mouth of an horſe, that he may obey the rider: ſo tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is the bodyes bitt vnto obeying the ſoul, in regard it ſuppreſſeth the iuſt of the flesh, that foments diſquietnes, and trouble to the mind.</p>

               <p>The only daughter of temperance, and nurce to all other morall virtues is abſtinence, which coueteth nothing, but what is conſonant to the light of

God did bleſſ the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geny, that proceeded from Lot, and his daughters: therfore Lot, and his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters retained charity, that is, continued in holy ſociety, and freindshipp with God notwithſtanding their externall ſin of<note n="*" place="margin">Jn filia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus Lot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priè fuit pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum ince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus, vt fusè probat Aug. l. <hi>22.</hi> contrae faustum, cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ab illis fuerit cauſatum voluntariè.</note> inceſt: but good God, what a poore demonſtratiue argument is this? where the antecedent propoſition is euidently falſe, and the conſequence, (ſuppoſe the antecedent were true) very inconſequently deduced.

For example God bleſſed the iſſue of Iudas, and Thamar in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, Chriſt as man deſcending from it, albeit, that both were grieuous ſinners in order to the bringing forth of the ſaid iſſue: for Iudas the Father volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily committed ſimple fornication, and Thamar the mother the ſin of inceſt. But perhaps the ſtudent of 40. yeares ſtanding will alledge, that the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent afore mentioned: <hi>That God did bleſſ the progeny</hi> &amp;c. is meant of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall bleſſings only, and indeed it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denyed, but that the ſaid progeny, for example Moab the ſon of Lots elder daughter, and Ammon ſon of the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, were heads of great nations, the Moabites deſcending from the one, and the Ammonites from the other; yet this
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:66422:126"/>anſwer will auail him nothing at all, as to the point of the preſent difficulty, being it implieth manifeſt weaknes to infer from the worldly aduantages of Moab, and Ammon, that Lot, and his daughters retained charity, that is, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſociety with God in the outward ſin of inceſt.

It was an oblation exhibited to God alone: for Chriſt in celebrating the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt addreſſed all his ſpeeches to his diuine Father: laſtly there is obſeruable recognition of diuine omnipotency, as is plainly euidenced by the oblation it ſelf, ſince it ſucceeded not only in the room of the Paſcall lamb: but of all the other ſacrifices of the law of Moyſes and conſequently ought to containe in it ſelf the perfect morall ſignification eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall to thoſe ſacrifices, which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognition of diuine omnipotency, and repreſentation of the ſacrifice of the croſſ.

And albeit, that Chriſt by one ſole bloody oblation, that is, by once of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering himſelf in a bloody manner, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummated the generall redemption; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſ he did not think fit to make that one generall oblation an effectuall redemption, or remiſſion of ſins wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thout the application therof: for ſo he had entailed the kingdom of Heauen vpon euery ſinner, and conſequently deueſted himſelf of all power to diſinhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit any for what fault ſoeuer. But the applicatiue perfection, as to a ſacrifice, he gaue to the vnbloody oblation only, which by his own inſtitution, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, is and shall be the externall ſeruice of the new Teſtament, and the continuall application of his paſſion vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſanctification; As corporall remedies how perfect, and ſufficient ſoeuer doe no cure vpon a ſick body, that is to ſay

Wherfore their abſolution from ſinnes by offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſacrifice, and their miniſtring the Sacraments, ought to be counted as Chriſts own abſolution, remiſſion, or pardon, being the abſoluing from, and remitting ſinnes in the room of Chriſt: in like manner their preaching, and exhorting in ſtead of Chriſt, is, as if it were Chriſt's own preaching and exhorting, the office of Biſhops and Prieſts, being the Vicarship of Chriſt. So that when the ſame Apoſtle ſaith Hebrae. 8. that Chriſt onely is the Prieſt of the new law, or Teſtament, his meaning is, that Chriſt is the chief Prieſt, that is the Prince of Prieſts to whom as to his Ambaſſadours he hath committed the miniſtery of reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In the old law according to the Apoſtle Hebrae. 7. there was a ſeries of many chief Prieſts ſucceeding one an other in that function, for none of all them was of perpetuall durance. But in our new law there is but one chief Prieſt, or Bishop that shall endure for euer, and all other Prieſts are his Vicars onely, who in his room exerciſe Prieſtly function viſibly: wherfore Chriſt is chief Prieſt for euer, and exerciſeth his Prieſthood by his ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute Miniſters, or Vicars, which execute the office of reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for him, and in his room.</note> miniſtery of reconciliation

So that vndoubtedly by a ſpeciall proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the name Euchariſt is appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the ſacrifice of Chriſt his body, and blood, to the end, that euen the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me therof might excite Prieſts (whos office, and function it is to ofter that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice) to imitate the thankſgiuing, that Chriſt exhibited in the enterpriſe of this miſtery.</p>
               <p>The name Maſſ comes of <hi>Miſſa</hi> which is latine doubtleſſ, for if it had been an Hebrew word, the vſe therof would ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue remained, and continued among the greek Fathers, as well as of <hi>Alleluya,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:66422:156"/>Oſanna, Amen,</hi> which be Hebrew words; But none of the Greek Fathers vſe this term <hi>Miſsa,</hi> and conſequently it is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination which the people of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Church haue impoſed to expreſſ the ſacrifice of Chriſt his body, and blood, and ſignifies the ſame thing, that <hi>dimiſſio</hi> in latine: that is to ſay, diſmiſſing, or ſending away; for in the primitiue Church it was an ordinary ceremony practiſed by the Deacon, to cry aloud twice in the Church, during the time of celebrating diuine ſeruice: <hi>Ite Miſſa eſt:</hi> once in the begining of the miſtery, or ſacrifice, wherin the Catecumens were not ſuffered to be preſent being Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers vnbaptiſed; ſignifying therby, that all ſuch should depart out of the Church; and once again in the end of the ſaid miſtery, or ſacrifice, intimating therby the dimiſſing, or ſending away of the faithfull baptiſed. This ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the name <hi>Miſſa</hi> (in English Maſſ) and this originall grownd therof is approued by the vniform judgment of the maior part of orthodox writers. Howeuer the appropriation of the ſaid name, as to ſignifying the ſeruice of the miſtery, or ſacrifice of Chriſts body, and blood, is deriuable euen from the

The Hebrew was ſanctified from the beginning of the world: God euen then conferring with Adam in the Hebrew tongue, and teaching him the names of each liuing creature. Gen. 2.

But it ſeemeth a ſtrange thing, that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. White should preſume to gather from the words ſet downe, that good ſouls shall not be releaſed of the paines, which they ſufferin Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory before the generall Reſurrection, the ſaid words not carrying the leaſt ſound that way: for they neither ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke of pain's in order to the next life, nor of releaſing ſouls out of Purgatory: and indeed the Apoſtles ſole intent in the Chapter alledged, is to proue the Reſurrection of the dead, and to that purpoſe brings ſundry argument's. The firſt whereof is that Chriſt our head is raiſed vp, and therfore we his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers shall riſe again in regard of the faſt connection, that is between the head, and the members thereof. And what Mr. White alledgeth for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment of ſouls to the day of Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a ſecondary argument, which S. Paul vſeth only as a confirmation of his firſt argument to demonſtrate the
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:66422:258"/>Reſurrection of bodyes, ſignifying ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that he himſelfe together with the reſt of the Apoſtles, and primitiue Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians of thoſe day's had ſuffered in vain afflictions, and tribulations if ſou'ls had been mortall, and conſequently ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to riſe again: for t'is clear by the very forme of the Apoſtles ſpeech, that he ſuppoſed the falſe opinion, that tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth ſouls to be mortall, whence of neceſſity would follow, that there should be no Reſurrection at all: and truly if the Apoſtle had not made that ſuppoſall, he would haue concluded nothing; for ſuppoſing ſouls to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall, good works of this life would haue much aduantaged him for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of Heauenly bleſſedneſſ, though no Reſurrection at all had followed. And the ſame ſuppoſall is made by the holy writer of the Macchabies, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſying therby if the dead were not to riſe again, it would follow; that ſoul's were mortall in conſequence of which all prayers offered for them would be in vain; where is obſeruable, that the Iewish ſectaryes, to wit, Sadducies held, that the ſoul's were mortall, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently denied the Reſurrection of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: other Iewes which belieued aright,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:66422:259"/>profeſſed immortality together with the Reſurrection, there being in each ſoul an innate deſire to reſume the body wherof it was the true form once, and as to reaſon it is moſt conſonant, that God, who createth nothing in vain, will not fruſtrate that deſire: hence it was, that the ancient Iew's ſpoak of the immortality of ſouls, and the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of bodyes alike: and our Sauiour Chriſt <hi>Math.</hi> 22. to proue to the Saddu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies the Reſurrection of bodies infer's it from the immortality of the ſoul, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that ſcripture-teſtimony: <hi>I am God of Abraham, God of Iſaack, God of Iacob, and ſubſumeth thus: there is no God of the dead, but of the liuing,</hi> arguing therby, that the dead riſe again, ſince their ſouls doe not die with their bodyes.

Wherefore Chriſt Mat. 23. commanded the people to doe what the Scribs, and Phariſies ſaid in regard they ſate in the Chair of Moyſes And S. Iohn cap. 11. aſcribes not the truth of Caiphas propheſing, that Chriſt ought to die, for the ſafety of that nation vnto his ſpeaking, as of himſelfe, but to his ſpeaking, as high Prieſt of that ſame yeare, which rendered him infallible in ſpeaking: in conſequence of which ſeeing, that God ſo directed the high Prieſt in the old law, that he could not ſpeake an vntruth from the Chair of Moyſes, it follows of neceſſity, that Chriſt in his own new law of grace ſo ſpecially aſſiſtes the high Prieſt his grand Vicar, and ſupream head of the Church (which he built on his beloued Apoſtle S. Peter, that he cannot tell a lye from the Chair of the ſame S. Peter) the firſt high Prieſt of the new law after Chriſt. Wherefore the Churches ſupream Gouernour that ſucceds in that Chair cannot erre in his decrees, that concerne matters of faith, or generall manners, notwithſtanding that he were as wicked as Caiphas. From hence plainly appear's the manifeſt weaknes of ſundry ſectaries, which will haue the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Prieſts ſentence no longer to bind, then, hee pronounces ſentence in conformity to the word of God: for there is no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable authority ſaue that of the ſupream Paſtours Tribunall, which can aſſure vs of the diuine word: for the ſcripture would not be belieued, if it were not warranted from the infallible Chair of S.

Moreouer ſundry ſectaries ſay vnaduiſedly, that in the old law the ſentence of the high Prieſts concerned only ciuill matters in debate, and not controuerſies pertaning to faith and religion, for as to this point both the ſecond book of paralipomenon, and the 24.

               <p>An other neceſſary propriety requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the ſupream Iudg, is authority to exact obedience vnto his ordinances: which eſſentiall propriety Chriſt decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, when ſpeaking of the ſcribes, and Phariſies ſitting in Moyſes chaire. <hi>Math.</hi> 23. he ſaid, <hi>all therfore whatſoeuer they bid you obſerue, that obſerue, and doe:</hi> where the particles <hi>whatſoeuer they bid you obſerue,</hi> importe power, and authority to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound vnto the Iews, what they were to belieue: and the particles: <hi>that obſerue, and doe:</hi> import an obligation to admit, and receiue their ordinances: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed euery common-wealth hath a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Iudg, or magiſtrate, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth laws, and ordinances vnto ſubiects, and commandeth their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance thereunto.</p>

               <p>But to whom shall it belong to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish the foundamentall Articles from not foundamentall, and meer arbitrary?
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:66422:342"/>not to the Pope ſurely and ſuch Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s as yeeld obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to his Holines becauſe theſe acknowledge for foundamentall Articles, what the Council of Trent hath defined: nor to the ancient Church, in regard, that fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tyme to tyme, she hath condemned, and excommunicated tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, which diſſented from any poynt of the generall faith, or from generall Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uncils: for though the Pelagians, Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, and other ſectaries confeſſed the miſteries of the Trinity, and Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and other foundamentall Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Chriſtian faith: neuertheleſſ they were not tolerated, but anathematiſed by the ancient Church, and by the Fathers execrated, as Heretiks. Yet perhaps it will be anſwered that the determination belong's to the vnanimous accorde of all thoſe which in any manner confeſſ, and worship Chriſt. But if the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall conſent of theſe were required for the making, or appointing foundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Articles neceſſary to the obtaining of ſaluation, this should be none, viz: <hi>The Diuinity of the ſon of God.</hi> Becauſe the Arians denyed it: nor <hi>The Diuinity of the holy Ghoſt.</hi> Being the Macedonians de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed it, nor <hi>The bleſſed Trinity</hi> becauſe the Sabellians denyed it. Nor the vnion
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:66422:342"/>between the diuine, and human nature in one diuine Perſon, for Neſtorius denyed that vnion: wherby euidently appears that tis not poſſible for Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate which Articles of faith be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tall, and which be not fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tall. That is, to ſet down preciſely ſuch Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of faith as can not be denyed wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thout loſſ of ſaluation, and ſuch again as to deny, is not damnable. Howeuer it is euident enough, that Proteſtants, (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueing neither vnion, as to diuine faith, nor communion as to the miniſtery of Sacraments with the Roman Church) cannot make a good claim to a viſible exiſtence, and perpetuall ſucceſſion of Paſtors, as deriued from her. Again their going out from that Church, which they confeſſ to haue been once the true Church of God, and ſtill to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine requiſits neceſſary vnto ſaluation, argueth them guilty of deadly ſchiſm, cauſed by themſelues, that departed from, and not by Catholicks, that abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in her. In euery ciuill ſtate ſuch as diſſobey, not ſuch as obey authority, ſuch as abrogate, not ſuch, as conſerue the ancient lawes, and ordinances, ſuch as reject, not ſuch as keep the ſetled cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes therof, bear the infimous brand

Beſides Proteſtants went out of the Roman Church without cauſe, for at the time of their departure, the Roman Church retained all requiſits neceſſary vnto ſaluation for then was there no Chriſtian Church vpon earth. Seperated from her, ſo that, when the Proteſtants reformation begun, the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church or none was the true Church of God, in conſequence of which their departure was without cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe.<note n="*" place="margin">Aug. l. <hi>3.</hi> de baptiſ. con.

Auſtin teacheth in his third book of baptiſm againſt
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:66422:343"/>the Donatiſts. Moreouer this aſſerted truth appeares euidently by the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall doctrines of Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which are as oppoſite to the faith of the Roman Church, as the ends of a Diameter are ouerwhart, and croſſ. For example Proteſtants commonly teach that good works proceeding from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine grace can neither iuſtify, nor me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſaluation, theſe being prerogatiues of faith only, in regard wherof it bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res the name of iuſtifying faith: but all ancient and modern Paſtors and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours of the Roman Church aſſert that good workes exerciſed in, and by diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne grace doe bring vnto iuſtification of life, and that they are in order to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, cauſes of euerlaſting ſaluation, as wicked workes in order to demerit, are cauſes of perpetuall damnation: Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants commonly teach, that the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Maſſ wherin Catholick Prieſts offer the body, and blood of Chriſt for the liuing, and dead; is a blaſphemous tale, and a da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous deuiſe. Proteſtants co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly teach, that confirmation, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, Order, Extream-vnction, and Matrimony want requiſits neceſſary to an Euangelicall Sacrament. Proteſtants commonly teach that the doctrines of
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:66422:344"/>Purgatory, Indulgences, religious vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of holy Reliks pertaining vnto, and inuocation of Saints are idle fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and trifles, crept into the Church without warrantable authority of ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture teſtimony. Proteſtants commonly teach ſundry other doctrines as foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall requiſits to their religion clean contrary to the faith of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church, as is manifeſtly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated in the Characters concerning the outward Sacrifice of Maſſe, Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, Penance, Order, Extrem-vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, Matrimony, Purgatory, Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, and Adoration. From the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes is inferred, that the Proteſtant. Reformation cannot borrow of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church viſible exiſtence together with continuall ſucceſſion of Paſtors vnto perpetuating that Church in foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall Articles of faith vnto excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from ſchiſm. Howeuer it cannot be denyed but that Proteſtants can shew clearly, that the whole body of doctrines foundamentall to Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm hath been aſſerted by ſundry lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, that liu'd in ſundry ages reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectiuely long before their reformation began: namly Simon Magus taught, that faith alone was an expedient, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:66422:344"/>vnto ſaluation, as witneſſeth S. Irenaeus, and rejected good works, as vnneceſſary therto, as doth atteſt Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Romanus: Manichaeus deſpiſed the Sacrifice of Maſſe, ſpoiling Chriſts Church of all outward ſacrifice, as wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeſ S. Auſtin: Nouatus impugned the Sacraments of Confirmation, Euchariſt Extrem-vnction, and Matrimony, as S. Cyprian affirmeth: Vigilantius deteſted the inuocation of Saints, and the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of their Reliques, and likewiſe ſingle life of Prieſts, as S. Hierom rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth: Iulian the Apoſtat had in deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the croſſ of Chriſt, and demolis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed his ſtatue, as Euſebius writeth: Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius condemned prayers and ſacrifices offered for the ſouls departed, as S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin, and S. Epiphanius auerre. But that which is exacted of the Proteſtants, is to shew from the firſt age for 1500. yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res a ſetled company of Chriſtians, and the place, country, town, or village where they liued, that taught and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the whole body of their founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall doctrines; it is not enough to produce the example of ſuch, as at dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent tymes, and in different places a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed with them in two, or three of their Articles, for that is not ſufficient
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:66422:345"/>vnto conſtituting a ſociety of true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieuers, becauſe ſo Turkes, and Iewes might be lifted for Proteſtants, theſe agreeing with them, as to ſundry Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, namely they deny the Popes ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, tranſubſtantiation, inuocation of Saints, and the ſacrifice of the Maſſe. Again the fore named ſectaries themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues were deſtitute of viſible exiſtence and perpetuall ſucceſſion, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently could not deriue either of both vnto the Proteſtant Church. Beſides Simon Magus, Manichaeus, Nouatus, Vigilantius &amp;c. bear the infamous brand of being condemned Hereticks before the Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts reformation begun. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer ſome Proteſtants there be that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour to proue their viſible exiſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in a long line of ſucceſſion from the Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſes but vnaduiſedly, firſt becauſe this ſeed of ſectaries knowes not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue the Genealogy of their own Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion down from the Apoſtles, which is the queſtion in debate wherin ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is expected: ſecondly the Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſes are condemned Hereticks, that taught doctrine impious, and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, for example, they aſſerted a good, and an euill God, denyed originall ſin, reiected baptiſm, and impugned the
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:66422:345"/>reſurrection of bodyes. By the premiſes plainly appeareth that Mark Antony de Dominis Bishop of Spalatto his diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction between foundamentall, and not foundamentall Articles of faith carrieth nothing of weight with it; t'is like a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious building, that wantes a good foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to ſupport it. And truly it is as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible an enterpriſe to proue the viſible exiſtence, and perpetuall ſucceſſion of Proteſtant Paſtours, from the Roman Church, as it is for Caluiniſts to shew that the true Church of God laid hid for ſundry ages inuiſible without peris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hing; which is impoſſible alſo: for the markes of a liu'd Church are profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of faith, preaching of the diuine word, inſtructing of the illiterate, and adminiſtring of the Sacraments, which functions can noe more be executed in a Church, that is inuiſible, then in a Church that is perished.</p>
